# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
data science course final project

This is a repository for the final assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course of the JHU Data Science Specialization. 

In this project raw data from persons performing physical activities recorded with smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope were cleaned into a final dataset with an average for each variable for each subject and activity. 

The "final tidy data.txt" file contains the final independent tidy dataset.

The "run_analysis.R" script is used to generate the final tidy dataset from the raw data files of test and train data.

The "Project codebook.Rmd" file contains a codebook which provides a description and overview of the project as well as a description of the final tidy dataset variables.
